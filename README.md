## ❤️ What we believe

I believe AI knowledge belongs to everyone, professionals, educators, NGO workers, students, and curious minds alike.

At the **ACAI Initiative** (Accessible AI), we’re making AI education as natural and energizing as its namesake superfood:  
**nourishing, modular, and easy to engage with**.

Through welcoming, judgment-free spaces, we help people:
- Build confidence without the overwhelm  
- Understand AI’s real potential and limitations  
- Reclaim agency in a rapidly changing world
